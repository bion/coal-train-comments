** Description

   This set of scripts centers around the invocation of the included Makefile.
   The Makefile sets up a dependency graph which defines the pipeline that
   generates all of the pages, database, and indexing. Read the Makefile to
   understand the pipeline better -- it is fairly well-commented.

** Dependencies

   You will need [[https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/][tesseract]] and [[https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&uddg=http%3A%2F%2Fpoppler.freedesktop.org%2F][pdftoppm]].

** Usage

   To generate everything, just run ~make~. This may take a while, though so it
   is advisable to run something like ~make -j `nproc`~, if you are able.

   It is possible to generate pages related to individual sections -- see
   the Makefile.
