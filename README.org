* coal-train-comments

  This set of scripts centers around the invocation of the included Makefile.
  The Makefile sets up a dependency graph which defines the pipeline that
  generates all of the pages, database, and indexing. Read the Makefile to
  understand the pipeline better -- it is fairly well-commented.

  To generate everything, just run `make`.
